## Icons
Few exceptions aside, all rendered at 24*24px.

## Margins
All paddings and margins used in the UI are powers of 2.

You’ll be able to replicate them fairly easily looking at the screenshots, as any wrong power of 2 used will result in significantly different looks. Aside from a few exceptions, I haven’t used any margins larger than 32px.

## UI Buttons
The dark buttons have a 4px corner radius, and a radial gradient. Top-center color #2E2E2E (46,46,46) to bottom-right color #1F1F1F (31,31,31). The icons and text inside the buttons are either white or one of the colors above.

When selected, the button glows in the same color as the icon and/or text it contains. The glow has a shadow (same color as the fill, no offset, 100% opacity, 4px blur). The contained icon/text turns to a dark #1F1F1F (31,31,31).

- The square, icon-only version (as found in the pause menus) is 48*48px. The 24px icon is centered. When selected, descriptive text appears 4px underneath centered. 8px horizontal spacing in between such buttons.
- The text-only version is 40px high and full column width minus margin (see ‘UI Backgrounds’ below). Text is left-aligned, 16px from the left side (montserrat 14 medium). 2px vertical spacing in between such buttons.
- The icon + text version is also 40px high and has the same margins on the sides as the text-only version. The icon is positioned 12px (!) from the left side, and has another 12px margin to the text.
- Inactive text (demo unlocks in …) and toggle modes (on/off) are in montserrat regular 14, white 50% opacity.

## UI Backgrounds
The translucent backgrounds of UI sidepanels and cards is black, 90% opacity and 8px gaussian background blur. If the blur turns out impossible, use pure black backgrounds.

- The width of these dark backgrounds is always 320px.
- In case sidepanels (as seen in the main menu and level editor) stick to the left side of the screen and occupy the full height. The content column within has 16px margin on either side.
- In case cards (in-game status card, steps card, level selection preview, level editor contextual settings cards etc.) stick to the bottom right or bottom left of the screen (16px H/V margin from the respective edge). Their height is variable based on contents. Unlike the sidepanels, the cards have a 4px corner radius. The content column within has 32px margin on either side.

## Transitions
The transitions between UI states will be clarified when most of it is done.
